r4 changes
	- system() fancy filenames
	- TODO : zzrtl() function for executing extra script
	- TODO : rom.flag() function ex rom.flag("dma1", 1),
	         rom.flag("minpad", 1);
	- TODO : minpad needs to do something
	- rom.dma_register() function for registering an offset
	  at which to write a dma index value after sorting
	- rom.dma_offset() function for retrieving offset of
	  file by dma index
	- rom.inject_prefix() function for adding a prefix to
	  an injected file; call rom.dma_prefix() after file
	  injection to get a pointer to the prefix to edit
	- rom.inject_mode() allows customizing file injection
	  behavior; pass 0 to use default, or a string:
	    "earliest" : use earliest available block
	                 (injects nearer to beginning of rom)
	    "latest"   : use latest available block
	                 (injects nearer to end of rom)
	    "smallest" : use smallest available block
	    "largest"  : use largest available block
	    "default"  : behaves the same as "smallest"
	    "0" or 0   : use "default"
	- TODO : icon
	- TODO : char *gui_file("save"/*or open*/) function
	- TODO : rom.file_dummy(data, numbytes) for packing data
	         after a compressed file
	         , no... for packing data before a file! ^^
	- TODO : 'strings' become "strings" in .rtl source code
	- TODO : rom.inject_zip(zipname, filename) will inject a
	         file from within a .zip file
	- TODO : injecting %d/%d is wrong
	- TODO : static.txt, static/ directory (will use a function
	         rom.inject_mode("static")

	- /Zel/ - MM script collaboration

r3 changes
	- final changes to make MM scripts possible
	- MM scripts are now available
	- updated OoT scripts
	- dump scripts now work on compressed roms
	- extension assertion: zzrtl now complains if
	  provided with a file not of the extension .rtl
	- raw data assertion: zzrtl now complains if
	  provided with a file that doesn't contain some
	  form of "int main" (e.g. an html file saved
	  with the .rtl extension)
	- added a function file_exists(fn) to check if a
	  file exists (returns 1 if it does, 0 otherwise)
	- rom.inject_dma() function added for injecting
	  a file over a known existing DMA entry
	  (file-size must match file being overwritten)
	  (rom.inject_raw_dma() also available)
	- rom.extract_dma() function added for extracting
	  a file of a known DMA index
	- .next() and .remaining() are now able to be
	  used with conf files of type list, for the
	  purpose of stepping through list items
	- .name() and .value() functions for retrieving
	  the name and value (as strings) of the
	  selected conf list item have been added
	- an int_array() function to make up for zzrtl
	  not supporting int array[32]; type declarations
	- a new_string() function for easy string building
	- rom version checking to reduce weird errors
	  encountered from using a dump/build script with
	  a rom not supported by it
	- loadfile() function added
	- tsv_col_row() function added

r2 changes
	- faster compression
	- compression ratio is now printed afterwards
	- removed zx7 codec (was slower than ucl and
	  had a worse compression ratio than ucl)
	- added aplib codec (better ratio than ucl, and
	  faster load times than ucl on Wii VC; the only
	  downside is roms take a few minutes to compress)
	- lzo and aplib patches are now available

	- Mikau6 - hardware testing

r1 changes
	- added compression codecs ucl, xz7, slowyaz
	- added support for deleted files in MM dmadata
	  specification (aka pstart == pend == -1)
	- added rearchive(), file_dma(), and cloudpatch()
	- added --compress command line argument so zzrtl
	  can be used as a standalone rom compressor
	- added --nocache command line argument for doing
	  compression without generating a cache folder
	- added --cloudpatch command line argument for
	  easy command line cloudpatching
	- added --help command line argument so a massive
	  wall of documentation doesn't pop up and scare
	  double-clickers away
	- stability improvements
	- when compressing a file makes it larger, its
	  uncompressed counterpart is used instead
	- better compressed file packing

r1 notes
	- individual files compressed with slowyaz are
	  byte-identical to those in retail roms; aside
	  from weird corner cases, there is no reason
	  you should use slowyaz; it is slower than yaz
	  and produces files slightly larger than yaz...
	- it should now contain everything necessary
	  to support Majora's Mask
