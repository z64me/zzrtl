# zzrtl

`zzrtl` is a filesystem management utility for Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. Filesystems are dumped and injected by way of the highly customizable scripts it interprets. It has built-in compression features, and projects built to my specification work on both original Nintendo 64 hardware and Wii Virtual Console.

Scripts for dumping and rebuilding OoT and MM's filesystems are available in this repo's [`script`](script) directory. Should you wish to tailor them to your project's specific needs, read the [manual](MANUAL.md). Use a plaintext editor with C syntax highlighting for the optimal editing experience. For Windows users, I recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

If you are looking for a dedicated compressor, try [`z64compress`](https://github.com/z64me/z64compress).

## How do I use this?

For beginners, the first paragraph of the [manual](MANUAL.md) is all you need to get started.

For advanced users looking for bleeding-edge functionality, check out [jaredemjohnson's fork](https://github.com/jaredemjohnson/zzrtl-audio). It adds support for sound, music, and text editing.
